# WebOne HTTP Proxy Server
This is a HTTP proxy server that makes old web browsers usable again in the Web 2.0 world.

It's designed to solve some problems on opening modern web sites in elderly browsers.

WebOne fixes HTTPS errors by removing too strict and difficult traffic encoding. Also it is editing webpage content to make it approitare for classic web browsers that don't know HTML5. Even browsers from 1995 now can be used to surf Web 2.0. With additional plugins it's now possible to watch YouTube on computers from 2000s.

So a one modern computer with Internet connection and WebOne can give a new life to older "brothers" in same LAN.
